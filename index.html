            CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a powerful stylesheet language that plays a crucial role in the design and presentation of web pages. It allows developers to separate content from design, enhancing the flexibility and maintainability of websites. With CSS, you can control the layout, colors, fonts, and spacing of elements, creating visually appealing and responsive designs that cater to various screen sizes and devices. The use of selectors, properties, and values enables developers to apply styles selectively, making it easy to create consistent designs across multiple pages.
